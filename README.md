  ### Goal
  The tool can create a password using:  
     1. Alphabetic characters upper and lower case for example ABC and or abc.  
     2. Numeric characters ranging from 0 - 9  
     3. The punctuation characters that would normally exist in the english language. I call these special characters.  
     4. A dedicated series of characters made up of numbers or special or characters or Alphabetic upper and lower case.
     5. Or a combination of two or more character types or all character types.
