  PassWordGenerator is a tool that has been to satisfy simple password encrytpion needs. Basically  
  
  ### Goal
  The tool can create a password using:  
     1. Alphabetic characters upper and lower case for example ABC and or abc.  
     2. Numeric characters ranging from 0 - 9  
     3. The punctuation characters that would normally exist in the english language. I call these special characters.  
     4. A dedicated series of characters made up of numbers or special or characters or Alphabetic upper and lower case.  
     5. Or a combination of two or more character types or all character types.  
  
  ### HighLevel
     1. Launch the tool by going to the following link https://xtended99.github.io/PassWordGenerator/  
     2. Once loaded depress the RED password generation button.  
     3. You will then see a series of pop ups that explain what to expect and how to interact with the tool.  
     4. Once you have selected all of the character types you would like included,
     5. The password genration tool will generate your password and displayed in the main tool box.
