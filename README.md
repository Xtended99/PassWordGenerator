       Most if not all original selectors and elements where removed or compressed in order to refactor the HTML page
         and make the style sheet more efficient. 


         Accesability features were added to the CSS Style sheet,
          TAB order with black border highlight
          Color hovering throughout the page
         
         I also took the liberty of changing the following 
            Making the left and right panel match on the button margin
            Enlarging and selecting a different so that is visually more accessible to a wider range of individuals
