    This is a is an extremely light weight interface that will generate a password by adhering to the following
    guidelines:

       Taken from the assignment README>md

             GIVEN I need a new, secure password
             WHEN I click the button to generate a password
             THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
             WHEN prompted for password criteria
             THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
             WHEN prompted for the length of the password
             THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
             WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
             THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
             WHEN I answer each prompt
             THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
             WHEN all prompts are answered
             THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
             WHEN the password is generated
             THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

      Under no circumstances other than for demonstration purposes should this interface and code be used over
      community or over publicly shared networks.

      The HTML will scale to phone type of devices.
